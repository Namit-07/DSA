# 📘 Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) – Java

This repository documents my **daily practice of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** using **Java**.  
The goal is to build **strong fundamentals**, improve **problem-solving skills**, and prepare for **technical interviews** and **competitive programming**.

---

## 🚀 Objectives
- Master core DSA concepts step by step
- Write clean, readable, and efficient Java code
- Understand **time and space complexity**
- Build consistency through daily practice
- Prepare for interviews, open-source contributions, and future internships

---

## 🧩 Topics Covered

### 📂 Arrays
- Reverse an Array
- Second Largest Element
- Check if Array is Sorted
- Count Even & Odd Elements
- Array Rotation (upcoming)
- Move Zeros to End (upcoming)

### 📂 Strings *(Planned)*
- Palindrome Check
- Reverse String
- Frequency Count

### 📂 Linked List *(Planned)*
- Traversal
- Insertion & Deletion
- Reverse Linked List

### 📂 Stack & Queue *(Planned)*
- Stack Implementation
- Queue Implementation
- Valid Parentheses

### 📂 Recursion *(Planned)*
- Basic recursion problems
- Backtracking fundamentals

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Language:** Java
- **IDE:** VS Code
- **Approach:** Logic-first, interview-oriented

---

## 📈 Learning Approach
- Problems are first implemented in **VS Code** to focus on logic
- Each solution includes:
  - Clear logic
  - Time & space complexity analysis
- LeetCode will be used later for pattern practice

---

## 🗓️ Progress Tracking
- Daily practice with consistent commits
- Structured learning plan instead of random problem solving
